## About lachaise2

This is the firmware for the HGA entry in local Boys and Girls Club of Rochester, MN Chair Affair. A touch responsive visual musical instrument.

This firmware runs on a MK20DX256VLH7 Cortex-M4 ARM processor on a Teensy 3.1 board. The primary interaces to the outside world are tactile and visual. The MCU interaces to an MPR121 multi-channel capacitive touch sensor, reading capacitance values from 10 metal strips that form a part of the chair. Inside the chair are 120 RGB LEDs that light in patterns dictated by the user's touch.
